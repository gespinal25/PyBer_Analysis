## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
	
   Based on the information provided, three business recommendation I can propose to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are first to creating discounts for city types that are not that popular to generate a more popularity.

Lastly, create promo code for frequent or non-frequent users to show appreciation to the customers for using the application.
